# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Kickstarter campaign has gathered data regarding monetary donations/pledges and their outcomes. Louise has requested help to organize, analyze and highlight the key points in identifying how the Kickstarter campaign can be more successful in the future. 

### Purpose

Louise is looking to manage the Kickstarter campaign more efficiently. In order to do so, the data presented must be organized and made easily readable. Once data has been "cleaned" up, we can begin to paint the picture of what Kickstarter categories are thriving and at which point in time, as well as, categories which may not be as fruitful. Creating visual representation of the data presented will help Louise see the big picture to the Kickstarter campaign and will allow her to run the campaign at a more elevated level of success. 

## Analysis and Challenges

From the analysis of the data one can identify that there are different times of the year that each category is more successful. The theater category appears to be the category with the most goal meeting success in the Kickstarter. 

Challenges which could be encountered are not properly converting the initial data to easily understand format in order to create comparison or correlation. If data is difficult to follow or read it can present a challenge when creating the data analysis, (ie, pivot tables, charts). Cleaned up data is key to creating an easy to follow analysis and allowing the a non-data analyst to see trends, to draw a proper conclusion.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In this analysis we reviewed the theater category, it's successful, failed and canceled titles. Based on the launch dates one can gather that the Theater category is has shown most success during the May, June and July months. There are 346 more successful titles in the Theater Category than failed. The number of cancelled titles is exceptionally low, at a total of 37 titles which is only 2% of the total Theater Category. The least amount of successful titles in the theater category were during the month of December, there is a significant decline in successful titles, the number of successful and failed titles is almost equal during this month. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this analysis we reviewed the plays subcategory of the theater category and the ability of the initial monetary goal to be met with the pledges gathered. From this data one can gather that the Kickstarter campaigns with goals under $10,000 were more successful gathering pledges to match the goals set. On average the success rate was slightly over 70%. 
 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Theater Kickstarters launched in the month of May were the most successful at gathering pledges to meet their goals.
The Theater Kickstarters launched in the month of December were least likely to gain enough pledges to meet their initial goal.  On the average, Louise can expect between 25 to 50 Theater Kickstarter titles per month, to not meet their initial goal amounts.  


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Plays subcategory is most likely to meet the goal amount for titles with goal values less than $10,000, with about a 70% rate of success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Limitations of these data sets "Outcomes Based on Goals" is this data is not broken down by country specific. Different cultures will influence the different percentage trends in a given year; traditions and seasonality by month will be contributing factors when identifying successes or failures by country. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Some other possible graphs which can be created would be specific year over year analysis within a category, pivot table and line charts. Identifying what outside factors contribute in a particular year to successes or failure within different categories would give Louise greater knowledge of the markets and possible trends between countries.
